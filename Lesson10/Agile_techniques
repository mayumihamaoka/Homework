Homework: Lesson 10 – Agile Techniques
Question 1
Complete definitions for Scrum related key terminology provided below.
SCRUM CEREMONIES
• Product backlog refinement: this is the act of adding detail, estimates, and order to items in the Product Backlog. 
• Sprint planning: This is where the team meets and decides what they need to complete in the coming sprint
• Daily scrum: This is a standup meeting, or a very short – 15-minute mini-meeting – for the team to make sure they’re all on the same page.
• Sprint review: This is another type of meeting, but one in which the team demos what they shipped in the sprint.
• Sprint retrospective: This is when the team reviews their work, identifying what they did well and what didn’t go as planned, so they can make the next sprint better.
SCRUM ROLES
• Scrum Master: The Scrum Master is accountable for the Scrum Team’s effectiveness. They do this by enabling the Scrum Team to improve its practices, within the Scrum framework.
Scrum Masters are true leaders who serve the Scrum Team and the larger organization.
• Product Owner: They are responsible for maintaining a product backlog that describes the product that must continue to fit with the requirements of the business. During any project, as more becomes known about a product, about customers, or about changes in the market, a product often needs to change in order to meet these requirements. The Product Owner has to adjust and re-prioritise the backlog to fit these changes and to steer the project.
• Development Team: the people in the Scrum Team that are committed to creating any aspect of a usable Increment each Sprint. The team can be composed by designers, writers, programmers, etc. 


Question 2
You are leading a development team that was given a task to create a new yoga booking system.
High level description of the system is as follows:
• It has a very simple interface to accept user input (bookings) and display classes information
• All bookings, appointments, schedule etc should be stored in a SQL database.
• There is ‘backend’ system that should be written in Python to handle the logic and manage
the data flow.
Your team has two weeks to build a simple prototype that will be shown to the client to seek their
feedback and discuss further enhancements.


TASK
• Break this task into smaller stories (chunks of work) for the team to work on.
• Assume that one person works on one task.
• Mark tasks that can be worked on in parallel and perhaps those that need to be worked on
in particular order.
