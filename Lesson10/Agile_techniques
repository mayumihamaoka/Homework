You are leading a development team that was given a task to create a new yoga booking system.
High level description of the system is as follows:

• All bookings, appointments, schedule etc should be stored in a SQL database.
• There is ‘backend’ system that should be written in Python to handle the logic and manage
the data flow.
Your team has two weeks to build a simple prototype that will be shown to the client to seek their
feedback and discuss further enhancements.


TASK

in particular order.
